This repository implements the demonstration extrapolation method from Imitation Learning to Outperform Demonstrators by Directly Extrapolating Demonstrations. The implementation of <a href="https://github.com/gdebie/stochastic-deep-networks" target="_blank">SDN</a> are based on their official codebase, the implementations of PPO and GAIFO are based on 
<a href="https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail/tree/master/a2c_ppo_acktr/algo" target="_blank">
pytorch-a2c-ppo-acktr-gail</a> by ikostrikov, and the implementation of GAIFO is based on 
<a href="https://github.com/illidanlab/opolo-code" target="_blank">opolo-code</a> by illidanlab. Please refer to run.sh for running the demonstration extrapolation method.
